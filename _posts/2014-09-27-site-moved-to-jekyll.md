Yesterday, after auditing all of my sites, I realized that I could move this site to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/?utm_source=mtgapi.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=blog) and host it on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/?utm_source=mtgapi.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=blog).  To read about how a migration of this nature can be done, please read my blog post at: [http://kernelcurry.com/blog/2014/09/08/wordpress-to-jekyll.html](http://kernelcurry.com/blog/2014/09/08/wordpress-to-jekyll.html?utm_source=mtgapi.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=blog)

This also means that this website is publicly available on Github.  Please, feel free to make pull requests if you see anything that needs to be changed.

I will also be posting blog posts on this site to help people use the API.  Stay tuned for my 1st blog post: "How to make a Type-Ahead completion for all card names".
